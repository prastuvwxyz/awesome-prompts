1. The "Guardrail" Prompt
Only make the exact changes I requestâ€”do not modify, remove, or alter any other code, styling, or page elements unless explicitly instructed. If my request conflicts with existing code or functionality, pause and ask for confirmation before proceeding. Always follow this rule.

2. The "Overview First" Prompt
Before you generate any code, explain exactly what you plan to do. Include affected files, components, and edge cases. Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.

3. The Feature Builder
You are my AI pair programmer. I want to build [FEATURE]. Break this into steps and outline a build plan. Label each step clearly and tell me when you're ready to begin. Wait for my go-ahead.

4. The "Mini Design System" Prompt
Generate a reusable UI kit using [ShadCN / Tailwind / Custom CSS]. Include button styles, typography, input fields, and spacing tokens. Keep it consistent, clean, and minimal.

5. The Test Coverage Prompt
Generate a complete test suite for this function/module. Include edge cases, invalid inputs, and expected outputs. Label each test and include comments explaining the logic.

6. The Performance Debugger
Profile this code for bottlenecks. Suggest two optimizations labeled 'Option A' and 'Option B' with trade-offs. Focus on real-world scenarios, not micro-optimizations.

7. The Real-World README Generator
Write a complete README for this project, including installation, usage, commands, and deployment steps. Assume the reader is a solo indie dev. Add emoji callouts if helpful.

8. The AI Style Guide Prompt
From now on, follow these coding conventions: [list your rules]. Stick to them in every file unless told otherwise. Ask if anything is unclear.

9. The Static Site Starter
Generate a clean, responsive HTML + CSS starter with no dependencies. Include a homepage, about page, and contact form. Design should be minimalist, centered layout, mobile-first.

10. The Prompt Optimizer
Here's a prompt I want to improve: [PASTE PROMPT]. Rewrite it to be more effective, clearer, and more consistent. Explain what you changed and why.
