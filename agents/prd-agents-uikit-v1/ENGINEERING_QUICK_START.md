# Engineering Quick Start Guide

This guide shows engineering teams how to immediately use the UI Kit PRD Agent System output for sprint planning and development.

## ðŸš€ From PRD to Sprint in 30 Minutes

### Step 1: Extract Your Task List (5 minutes)
After running the Task Generator agent, you'll get structured output like this:

```yaml
user_stories:
  story_dev_001:
    story_id: "DEV-BTN-001"
    as_a: "Flutter Developer"
    i_want: "to implement a basic UIButton"
    so_that: "I can quickly add interactive elements"
    
    implementation_tasks:
      - task_id: "TASK-BTN-001"
        title: "Create UIButton widget foundation"
        story_points: 5
        assignee_type: "frontend_developer"
        sprint: 1
        dependencies: []
```

### Step 2: Import to Your Project Management Tool (10 minutes)

#### For Jira
```bash
# Use the provided task IDs and descriptions
# Story points are pre-estimated
# Dependencies are clearly marked
# Acceptance criteria are detailed

Epic: EPIC-BTN-001 "Button Component Family"
â”œâ”€â”€ Story: DEV-BTN-001 "Basic Button Implementation" (13 points)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task: TASK-BTN-001 "Create widget foundation" (5 points)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task: TASK-BTN-002 "Add interaction handling" (3 points)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task: TASK-BTN-003 "Theme integration" (3 points)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Task: TASK-BTN-004 "Accessibility foundation" (2 points)
â””â”€â”€ Story: DEV-BTN-002 "Advanced Customization" (21 points)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Task: TASK-BTN-005 "Variant system" (5 points)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Task: TASK-BTN-006 "Size system" (3 points)
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

#### For Linear/Asana/Monday
- Copy task titles and descriptions directly
- Use provided story point estimates
- Set up dependencies using task IDs
- Assign based on `assignee_type`

### Step 3: Sprint Planning (15 minutes)

The agent provides ready-to-use sprint plans:

```yaml
sprint_1_foundation:
  sprint_goal: "Establish UIButton foundation with basic functionality"
  duration_weeks: 2
  team_capacity: 26  # story points
  
  planned_tasks:
    - TASK-BTN-001 (5 points, Frontend Dev 1)
    - TASK-BTN-002 (3 points, Frontend Dev 2)
    - TASK-BTN-003 (3 points, Frontend Dev 3)
    - QA-BTN-001 (2 points, QA Engineer)
  
  definition_of_done:
    - "UIButton renders on all platforms"
    - "Unit test coverage >90%"
    - "Basic accessibility functional"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Daily Development Workflow

### For Developers
Each task comes with:
- **Clear deliverables** - Exact files and features to implement
- **Acceptance criteria** - How to know when you're done
- **Dependencies** - What must be completed first
- **Testing requirements** - What tests to write

### For QA Engineers
Quality tasks are embedded throughout:
- **Testing strategy tasks** - Define test approaches
- **Test implementation tasks** - Write automated tests
- **Validation tasks** - Verify acceptance criteria

### For Tech Leads
Coordination tasks help manage the work:
- **Architecture review tasks** - Ensure code quality
- **Performance optimization tasks** - Meet benchmarks
- **Documentation tasks** - Enable team knowledge sharing

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking

### Sprint Burndown
Use the provided story points for accurate burndown tracking:
- Each task has realistic estimates
- Dependencies prevent work blocking
- Quality gates ensure steady progress

### Definition of Done Checklist
Every sprint includes clear completion criteria:
```yaml
definition_of_done:
  functional_requirements:
    âœ… "All button variants implemented"
    âœ… "Cross-platform compatibility verified"
    âœ… "Theme integration functional"
  
  quality_requirements:
    âœ… "Code review approved"
    âœ… "Test coverage >90%"
    âœ… "No critical bugs"
  
  documentation_requirements:
    âœ… "API docs complete"
    âœ… "Usage examples provided"
```

### Business Value Tracking
Every task connects to user stories:
- **Developer efficiency** - How much time saved
- **User experience** - How users benefit
- **Business impact** - How company benefits

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Examples

### Task: TASK-BTN-001 "Create UIButton widget foundation"

**What to implement:**
```dart
// File: lib/src/components/button/ui_button.dart
class UIButton extends StatelessWidget {
  const UIButton({
    Key? key,
    required this.onPressed,
    required this.child,
    this.variant = UIButtonVariant.primary,
    this.size = UIButtonSize.medium,
    this.disabled = false,
    this.loading = false,
  }) : super(key: key);

  final VoidCallback? onPressed;
  final Widget child;
  final UIButtonVariant variant;
  final UIButtonSize size;
  final bool disabled;
  final bool loading;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Implementation here
  }
}
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- âœ… Widget compiles without errors
- âœ… Renders in example app
- âœ… onPressed callback works
- âœ… Basic styling applied

**Tests to write:**
```dart
testWidgets('UIButton renders with required props', (tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(
    MaterialApp(
      home: UIButton(
        onPressed: () {},
        child: Text('Test'),
      ),
    ),
  );
  
  expect(find.text('Test'), findsOneWidget);
});
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Integration

### Design Handoff
Designers provide:
- **Figma components** with all variants
- **Design tokens** (colors, spacing, typography)
- **Interaction specifications** (animations, states)

### Implementation Alignment
Tasks include design validation:
- Visual regression testing
- Design token compliance
- Cross-platform consistency

## ðŸš¦ Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing Pipeline
Each component gets comprehensive testing:
```yaml
testing_strategy:
  unit_tests: ">90% coverage"
  widget_tests: "All user interactions"
  integration_tests: "Critical user flows"
  performance_tests: "Render time <16ms"
```

### Manual Testing
QA tasks include:
- Cross-platform testing
- Accessibility validation
- User experience verification

## ðŸ“± Platform Considerations

### Flutter Specific
- **Mobile**: Touch targets, haptic feedback
- **Web**: Hover states, keyboard navigation
- **Desktop**: Focus management, right-click support

### React/React Native
- **Web**: Browser compatibility, responsive design
- **Mobile**: Native feel, platform conventions

## ðŸ”„ Iteration and Feedback

### Sprint Retrospectives
Use task completion data to improve:
- **Estimation accuracy** - Adjust story points
- **Dependency management** - Reduce blocking
- **Quality gates** - Improve definition of done

### Component Evolution
Tasks support component enhancement:
- **Version updates** - Breaking change management
- **Feature additions** - Backward compatibility
- **Performance improvements** - Optimization tasks
