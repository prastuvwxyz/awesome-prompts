# UI Kit PRD Agent System

A comprehensive, framework-agnostic prompt agent system for building Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for UI component libraries. This system generates detailed specifications that can be implemented across multiple frameworks including Flutter, React, React Native, Vue, Angular, and more.

## üéØ Purpose

Create production-ready UI Kit PRDs that rival industry standards like Material-UI (MUI), Ant Design, and Chakra UI, with design patterns inspired by modern dashboard systems like Minimal UI. **Most importantly, this system generates actionable user stories and engineering tasks that development teams can immediately implement.**

## ‚ö° Key Innovation

Unlike traditional design system documentation, this agent system produces **sprint-ready engineering deliverables**:

- **User Stories** with clear acceptance criteria
- **Task Breakdown** with story point estimates  
- **Sprint Planning** with dependencies and timelines
- **Quality Gates** with definition of done
- **Cross-team Coordination** for design, engineering, and QA

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
